This repository contains the code and Jupyter notebooks I used for various data science-related projects. Below is a brief description of each project.

## Face Covering Detection with Ring Devices (2023)

Summary: I started a personal project to build a system that could detect face coverings in home security videos recorded by Ring devices.

Data Collection & Preparation: I gathered videos from Ring Neighbors and other online sources. I used these videos to train my model to recognize people wearing face coverings.

Building and Setting Up the System: After training, I set up my models on cloud services like AWS. This allowed me to create a system that can quickly tell users when it sees a face covering in their video footage.

Skills Used: 
Working with complex, real-life data
Building models to solve practical problems
Setting up and deploying models on cloud services like AWS

NOTE: the code for this project is not in the repository, but you can see a video demonstration of the project here https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Angf-GPvpG8


## Netflix Ratings Predictions (2023)

Summary: I worked on a project inspired by the famous Netflix ratings prediction contest. I created a complete process to develop a model, starting with preparing the data and ending with evaluating the model's performance.

Approach & Implementation: As part of my modeling pipeline I incorporated feature engineering, clustering, and data visualization.

Skills Demonstrated: 
Understanding and following best practices in machine learning
Analyzing and understanding large amounts of data and machine learning results


## RSNA Breast Cancer Detection Challenge (2023)

Summary: The project is based on a Kaggle competition that aims to predict breast cancer from mammograms accurately. My partner and I developed a full model process, starting from cleaning up the data to evaluating the model's performance.

Approach & Implementation: We used the best practices in model development and applied deep learning techniques, like convolutional neural networks, hyperparameter tuning, transfer learning, and object detection models. We also focused on making our model explainable and understandable.

Skills Demonstrated: 
Knowledge of best practices in developing machine learning models
Use of advanced deep learning techniques
Ability to work with complex data, such as mammogram images


## Big Data Derby (2022)

Summary: I took part in an open-ended competition sponsored by the New York Racing Association (NYRA). The challenge was to find interesting insights from data collected from horse races, including horse tracking data.

Approach & Implementation: In my approach, I built a model that could predict a horse's chances of winning the race as it progresses. The model used live race data to continually update the winning probabilities.

Skills Demonstrated:
Creative ways to use the available data 
Presenting data in an understandable way 
Making sense of the model's results 
Building a model that works with chances and probabilities
